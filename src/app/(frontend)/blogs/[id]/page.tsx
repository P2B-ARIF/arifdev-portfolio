					"Introduction: The Challenge of Dynamic Content in Static Sites",
				content:
					"Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js offers incredible performance and security benefits. Pages are pre-rendered at build time, leading to lightning-fast load times. However, a common challenge arises when your content needs to be frequently updated, like a news feed, e-commerce product prices, or real-time data. Rebuilding the entire site for every small change can be impractical and time-consuming.\n\nThis is where Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) comes into play. ISR allows you to leverage the benefits of static sites while providing a mechanism to update content dynamically, without requiring a full site rebuild. It's a game-changer for content-heavy applications.",
			},
			{
				heading: "What is Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)?",
				content:
					"At its core, ISR is a Next.js feature that allows you to update static pages *after* they've been built and deployed. Instead of regenerating a page on every request (like SSR) or only at build time (like pure SSG), ISR enables revalidation of static pages at a specified interval.\n\nWhen a user requests an ISR page:\n\n1.  If the page exists in the cache and the revalidation interval hasn't passed, the cached (static) version is served instantly.\n2.  If the revalidation interval *has* passed, the cached version is served *first*, while Next.js regenerates the page in the background. Once the regeneration is complete, the new version replaces the old one in the cache for subsequent requests.\n\nThis 'stale-while-revalidate' strategy provides the best of both worlds: immediate page loads for users and up-to-date content.",

				heading: "When to Use ISR?",
				content:
					"ISR is ideal for:\n\n* **Blogs and News Sites:** Update individual articles or news feeds without rebuilding the entire site.\n* **E-commerce Product Pages:** Reflect price changes, stock updates, or new reviews dynamically.\n* **Documentation Sites:** Keep documentation current as features evolve.\n* **Marketing Pages:** Update promotions or campaign details without affecting site performance.\n\nIf your content updates frequently but doesn't require real-time, millisecond-level freshness for every user, ISR is likely the perfect fit.",
			},
			{
				heading: "Considerations and Best Practices:",
				content:
					"* **Choosing the `revalidate` time:** Set an interval that balances content freshness with server load. For rapidly changing data, a shorter interval is better, while for less frequent updates, a longer one suffices.\n* **On-demand Revalidation (Next.js 12+):** For critical updates (e.g., publishing a new blog post), you can trigger revalidation manually via an API route. This provides immediate updates when necessary, overriding the `revalidate` timer.\n* **Error Handling:** Ensure your data fetching logic within `getStaticProps` handles errors gracefully, so stale content is served rather than breaking the page.",
